  detect what piece the mouse clicked on.

TODO

Function to determine location of each poly of each piece
  Use this to avoid conflicts in spatial arrangement w/ board or pieces.

Store locations of each piece's polys locally

Store locations of each piece's polys globally (single large grid)
  This will need to be done during piece placement

Cannot exit selection unless piece is placed fully within/fully outside the play
area. An on-screen message should appear if there is any discrepancy.

On-screen timer (stopwatch)
  Stops when blocks are in an acceptable arrangement
